MultiDOF joints untested, unlikely to work

Hold distance is measured from both the centre of the effector and hold model (possible unwanted side effects for objs) -> visualise this

starting_pose values are angles in radians

Use joint_test.py to find information about joint names

We only implement urdf & mjcf types for the config

Stances should match the size of end-effectors defined

Grasping actions are the last x elements, where x is the number of end-effectors

Actions are normalised to from -1 to 1
To attach the action must be >0

The order of the stances is the order the motion path will be set

The names of the holds and stances in the config do not matter
